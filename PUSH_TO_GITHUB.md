# Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

Your project is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `supply-chain-digital` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `Supply Chain Digital - Full-stack simulation platform with Angular, Spring Boot, Snowflake, and Databricks`
5. **Visibility**: Choose Public (for portfolio) or Private
6. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/rafiulalamkhan/SupplyProject

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supply-chain-digital.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/supply-chain-digital.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Check that all files are there
3. Verify that:
   - ✅ `.env` files are NOT visible (they're in .gitignore)
   - ✅ `node_modules/` is NOT visible
   - ✅ `target/` is NOT visible
   - ✅ `.env.example` IS visible
   - ✅ All source code is visible

## Step 4: Add to Your Portfolio

Update your portfolio with:

```markdown
## Supply Chain Digital

**Tech Stack**: Angular, Spring Boot, Snowflake, Databricks, Docker, Kubernetes

A comprehensive supply chain simulation platform for scenario analysis and optimization.

- **GitHub**: [View Repository](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supply-chain-digital)
- **Features**: Scenario builder, Monte Carlo simulations, real-time analytics
- **Architecture**: Microservices with async job processing
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "remote origin already exists":
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supply-chain-digital.git
```

### If you need to authenticate:
- GitHub may ask for username/password
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys for easier authentication

### To check what will be pushed:
```bash
git ls-files | head -20  # See what files are tracked
```

Your project is ready! 🚀
